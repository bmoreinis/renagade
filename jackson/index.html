 <h1>Michael Jackson Reappears Out of The Blue</h1>  
  <h3> By Jason Starzyk</h3> 
  <p>In a worldwide trend, thousands of Tik-Tokers are arguing about the identity of a new user who looks remarkably like Michael Jackson, the world-famous pop artist whose death a decade ago had been accepted as fact.</p>
  <p>Advocates for Jackson’s resurrection say the user looks just like Jackson.  Others believe the user is a Michael Jackson look alike being filmed without consent, as has been done with less famous people.  In these  <a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/fake-people-tiktok">Fake people
  </a> accounts, a hidden TikTok user takes videos and pictures of unsuspecting targets and posts them to the accounts along with profile data, and then messages from the account.</p>  <p>“He looks just like Jackson” Ben Thriller said. "I saw one video of him eating a banana bowl.”,“I have seen more videos and it looks like the look alike is not engoldened of the camera” Michael Dona. “I have also seen that he is doing normal everyday things nothing really fun to record.”  
This account has recently joined this site and people are still curious about the account.</p>  

<p>Breaking news more evidence on the Michael Jackson controversy according to one news official “I have done some digging and found out the account videos are like the type of videos that the other accounts that turned out to be fake so this one could be fake." He also states</p> 
<p>“Does know one find it weird that people are just being filmed and anyone could be a fake person.” In regard to if it is a fake person  
<img width="400" align = "right" style="margin-left:10px;" src="https://cdn.smehost.net/michaeljacksoncom-uslegacyprod/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7ed652247ea9199ac6aa8efd5f9d2c90.jpg" > 
“The idea of someone being randomly filmed without consent for entertainment scares me because it could happen to anyone.”</p> <p>More news on the Jackson topic the look a likes name is Robert Henry he likes to skate, so we went out to find him apparently, he has no idea who Michael is, he quotes

 “Who is Michael Jackson never heard of the guy”, He says he has been getting random messages and text asking if it is really him, he says. “My twitter is always going off and I want to be left alone."

 Now the question is who is this person recording him?</p>   

<p>We have recently uncovered the secret person behind all the fake celebrity accounts, it is someone by the name of Josh Tanning. He has been spotted outside of the olive garden taking videos of Robert and others, posting them on social media. He has also been stealing their information and selling it on the internet. He states he has no motive to do it. We just went to interview him, and he states he had no motive to start the account. He states,  "I had no idea that it was going to end up like this, it started as a joke". Now police are reviewing in court as the trial starts on the 5th, up next big bob banana bread.</p>
