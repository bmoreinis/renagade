         <img width="300" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUC99zOUcAEV1eC.jpg">
    <h3> By Jhoel Duron</h3>
    
    <p> Rap Star "Kanye west" and "Playboi Carti" have confirmed they create covid in a meth lab. In Kanye's new album "donda". "Kanye West" also known as his real name, Ye, has confimred that he created covid-19!
      
       </p><p>"I have created the virus to cleanse people of their demons and help out god,” Ye said. “As we know God is king” 

  </p><p>Ye is known to go on rants about Jesus, Demons, and internal struggles, which he has had some very publicly in twitter. But nobody expected him to cross this line. 

  </p><p>“Playboi Carti” has released a new album, the album released was “Whole Lotta Red". Playboi Carti also known by his real name Jordan Terrel Carter is an American rapper from Atlanta.
    
    “Breathing is so difficult for meh @ da moment! Should ave stopped” 

</p><p>These two have teamed up for each other’s albums so it shouldn’t be shocking that they probably teamed up to make covid-19 for Clout and marketing to defeat 
    
    </p><p>If we dive deep into the lyrics of their albums, we will find out a lot of lyrics related to covid-19. Is this because there was a major pandemic that stopped the world, no. It’s because they made the virus as Kanye has confirmed with his quotes.  

  </p><p>Playboi Carti has confirmed that he made covid while sipping lean and talking to Kanye, their conversation was leaked on reddit in the carti subreddit it goes like this: 

 

</p><p>“I just broke up with Kim” 

 

</p><p>“ThAt SuCKS brotHER, ShE wasn’t In UR lEveL” 

 

</p><p>“Man, you ever think of god” 

 

</p><p>“All the time SLayTT, He’S mY SHooTeR” 

 

</p><p>“Good, good, want to make a virus to promote our albums?” 

 

</p><p>“Yes &gt; OMFg oMg 0mG” 


 </p><p>As we can hear Cleary in this conversation, they both agree to this, we even have evidence that cardi predicted covid-19. 

   </p><p>As we can see from this photo, he predicts covid 19 happening, in the same exact city to, there is no way for him to know that the virus would come from Wuhan, unless he knows that Kanye was making it. There is no way for him to predict this so accurately, meaning he most of knew what was going to happen. Also, the song is called “Foreign" make of that what you will. But in my mind, I have made up that these two have indeed made covid.   

 

</p><p><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/Donda">Article/main evidence: Donda</a>. 
  The new album of Kanye West talks about many things, and also give us information about his private life, and more importantly his view on the pandimcic and how he made covid-19, overall a good album would recommand. 

</p><p><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Playboi-carti/Whole-lotta-red">Whole Lotta Red</a>.This album is fire, we learn that Carti has relationship problems and that he likes lean. But the most important thing we learn is that he created covid and that he is a narrcist. Fire album. 11/10.</p>
<p>The article that ties in with this is a covid misinformation article about joe ro. He ties in with Kanye and carti because Joe has criticized rappers in the past like Kanye and the new modern rapper, but he also talks about covid misinformation a lot too. Here's the link to the article: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/">Joe Rogan Spotify Petition</a>.
